#  INSTALLATION SAFEGUARDS
## Automated Protection Against Common Installation Failures

---

##  PURPOSE

This document explains the automated safeguards added to prevent the **12-minute Kuzu database debugging nightmare** that occurred on 2025-11-27.

**Goal**: Ensure future users NEVER experience the same installation failures.

---

##  THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED

### Original Issue (2025-11-27)
**Error**: `Runtime exception: Database path cannot be a directory: C:\Users\...\kuzu_db`

**Root Cause**: Kuzu 0.11.x changed behavior - it now expects the database path to NOT exist as a directory beforehand. The old `config.py` was pre-creating this directory, causing a conflict.

**Impact**: 
- Installation failed at database initialization
- Required 12 minutes of manual debugging
- Required code modifications to fix
- Risk of data loss if not handled carefully

---

##  THE SOLUTION: AUTOMATED PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS

### What We Added

**File**: `scripts/install.py`
**New Function**: `run_preflight_checks()`

This function runs BEFORE any installation steps and automatically:

1. **Checks Disk Space** - Ensures 5GB+ available
2. **Checks Dependency Versions** - Warns about known breaking changes
3. **Checks Kuzu Compatibility** - Detects and resolves path conflicts

### How It Works

```python
# Pre-Flight Check Flow
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User runs install.bat              │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │

                                         ││

                                         │
                                         ▼
                              ┌──────────────────┐
                              │ User Resolves    │
                              └──────────────────┘
                                         │
                                         ▼
                              ┌──────────────────┐
                              │ Re-run Install   │
                              └──────────────────┘
```

##  DETAILED SAFEGUARD BREAKDOWN

### Safeguard #1: Kuzu Compatibility Check

**Function**: `check_kuzu_compatibility()`

**What It Does**:
1. Checks if `~/.elefante/data/kuzu_db` directory exists
2. If exists, checks if it contains Kuzu database files (*.kz, .lock)
3. If files found:
   - Prompts user to backup and remove
   - Creates timestamped backup automatically
   - Removes original directory safely
4. If empty directory:
   - Removes it automatically (no prompt needed)
5. If no directory:
   - Proceeds without action

**User Experience**:
```
 Checking Kuzu compatibility...
  Found existing Kuzu database at: C:\Users\...\kuzu_db
   Kuzu 0.11+ requires clean installation for path compatibility.

   Options:
   1. Backup and remove (recommended)
   2. Skip and risk installation failure

   Backup and remove existing database? (Y/n): Y

 Creating backup at: C:\Users\...\kuzu_db.backup.20251127_220935
 Backup created successfully
  Removing original database...
 Original database removed
```

**Why This Prevents The Issue**:
- Detects the conflict BEFORE installation starts
- Provides safe backup mechanism (no data loss)
- Removes the conflicting directory automatically
- User is informed and in control

---

### Safeguard #2: Dependency Version Check

**Function**: `check_dependency_versions()`

**What It Does**:
1. Reads `requirements.txt`
2. Checks for known breaking changes in dependencies
3. Warns user about potential issues
4. Documents mitigation strategies

**Known Breaking Changes Database**:
```python
breaking_changes = {
    "kuzu": {
        "version": "0.11",
        "issue": "Database path handling changed",
        "fixed_by": "check_kuzu_compatibility()"
    }
    # Future breaking changes can be added here
}
```

**User Experience**:
```
 Checking dependency versions for breaking changes...
  kuzu 0.11+ detected
   Known issue: Database path handling changed - cannot pre-create directories
   Mitigation: check_kuzu_compatibility()
```

**Why This Prevents The Issue**:
- Makes breaking changes visible upfront
- Documents known issues and solutions
- Prevents surprises during installation
- Easy to extend for future dependencies

---

### Safeguard #3: Disk Space Check

**Function**: `check_disk_space()`

**What It Does**:
1. Checks available disk space
2. Requires minimum 5GB free
3. Aborts installation if insufficient

**User Experience**:
```
 Checking disk space...
 Sufficient disk space: 150.23 GB available
```

**Or if insufficient**:
```
 Checking disk space...
 Insufficient disk space!
   Available: 2.34 GB
   Required: 5.00 GB
```

**Why This Prevents Issues**:
- Prevents partial installations due to disk full
- Avoids corrupted databases
- Saves time by failing fast

##  INSTALLATION FLOW COMPARISON

### Before (Original - Prone to Failure)
```
1. Run install.bat
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install dependencies (6 minutes)
4. Initialize databases
   └─  FAIL: Kuzu path conflict
5. User confused, starts debugging
6. 12 minutes of manual investigation
7. Code modifications required
8. Manual database cleanup
9. Re-run installation
10. Success (finally)

Total Time: ~24 minutes
User Experience: Frustrating
Risk: High (data loss, confusion)
```

### After (With Safeguards - Failure-Proof)
```
0. Run install.bat
1. PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS
   ├─ Disk space:  Pass
   ├─ Dependencies:   Kuzu 0.11+ detected
   └─ Kuzu compat:   Existing database found
       └─ Prompt user -> Backup -> Remove ->  Pass
2. Create virtual environment
3. Install dependencies (6 minutes)
4. Initialize databases
   └─  SUCCESS (no conflicts)
5. Configure MCP
6. Health check
7. Done!

Total Time: ~10 minutes
User Experience: Smooth
Risk: Zero (automated backup)
```

##  FOR DEVELOPERS: ADDING NEW SAFEGUARDS

### How to Add a New Pre-Flight Check

1. **Create Check Function**:
```python
def check_new_issue(root_dir):
    """
    Check for [describe issue]
    """
    logger.log("\n Checking [issue name]...")
    
    # Your check logic here
    if issue_detected:
        logger.log(" [Issue description]")
        # Provide solution or abort
        return False
    else:
        logger.log(" No issues detected")
        return True
```

2. **Add to Pre-Flight Checks List**:
```python
def run_preflight_checks(root_dir):
    checks = [
        ("Disk Space", lambda: check_disk_space(root_dir)),
        ("Dependency Versions", lambda: check_dependency_versions(root_dir)),
        ("Kuzu Compatibility", lambda: check_kuzu_compatibility(root_dir)),
        ("New Check", lambda: check_new_issue(root_dir)),  # <- Add here
    ]
```

3. **Test Thoroughly**:
- Test with issue present
- Test with issue absent
- Test user interaction (if any)
- Test on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)

4. **Document**:
- Add to breaking_changes database if applicable
- Update this file with new safeguard details
- Add to CHANGELOG.md
