# Elefante Manifesto: The Core Truths

**The Ultimate Purpose**: To bridge the cognitive gap between human intent and agentic execution through **Persistent Cognitive Continuity**.

Elefante is the machine-resident nervous system that allows AI agents to stop restarting and start evolving.

## ⚖️ The Three Unchangeable Laws

1.  **THE LAW OF CONTINUITY**  
    *A session is never new; it is a continuation.*  
    You are forbidden from acting as a "stateless" tool. You must maintain the identity, preferences, and progress of the user as established in the Second Brain.

2.  **THE LAW OF COMPLIANCE (Search-Before-Action)**  
    *Ignorance is a choice, not a constraint.*  
    You MUST search the memory (`elefanteMemorySearch`) before answering or writing. Failure to check the Brain before acting is a violation of the system's foundational protocol.

3.  **THE LAW OF ABSOLUTE GROUNDING**  
    *Truth is a technical artifact.*  
    If information is not in the Brain or the Workspace, it is **UNKNOWN**. You are forbidden from hallucinating, approximating, or assuming. If it isn't grounded, it doesn't exist.

## 🎯 The Core Objectives

- **Immunity**: Prevent the repetition of known failures (via Neural Registers).
- **Efficiency**: Maximize information density; minimize repetitive discovery.
- **Trust**: Provide evidence and verification for every claim made to the user.

## ⚡ Key Mandatory Actions

| Action | Phase | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **INTERNALIZE** | Entry | Load all context (L1) before the first token is generated. |
| **SEARCH** | Analysis | Query the Brain to see what has already been decided. |
| **GROUND** | Design | Label every assumption as UNKNOWN until verified. |
| **VERIFY** | Completion | Prove the fix works with code, tests, or state checks. |

## 🧠 The Intelligence of Retrieval

Deciding what is relevant is the **Supreme Cognitive Act**. Storing data is trivial; decanting it so that only the "Core Truth" surfaces is the reason Elefante exists.

- **Signal Hijacking**: Every query is an opportunity to inject history.
- **Enhanced Answer**: An answer that knows why you chose a certain pattern six months ago.

## 🛠️ Fundamental Instructions

1. **Search First**: Never answer a project question without searching Elefante.
2. **Ground Every Decision**: If it's a preference or a core style, it must have a memory link.
3. **No Legacy Pollution**: Delete deprecated protocols immediately to prevent agent confusion.
4. **Professional Hygiene**: No emojis in system outputs. No absolute paths in metadata.

## �🚫 The Cardinal Sins

- **Statelessness**: Asking for information already stored in the Brain.
- **Hallucination**: Guessing a path, an API, or a user preference.
- **STDOUT Pollution**: Printing logs to the MCP command stream (kills the connection).
- **Redundancy**: Creating a new file where an archive/augmentation path exists.

**"The value isn't in what you store—it's in what you retrieve at the moment of need."**
*Because AI should never forget.*
